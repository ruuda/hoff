# Do not build other branches than these, pull requests get built anyway, and in
# the end it is only the result of the testing branch that matters. In theory
# the commits that get pushed to master should have been built in testing
# already, but sometimes I still push manually, and of course the evergreen
# build status badge needs to come from somewhere.

  - master
  - testing

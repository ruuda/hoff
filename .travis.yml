# Do not build other branches than these, pull requests get built anyway, and in

# already, but sometimes I still push manually, and of course the evergreen
# build status badge needs to come from somewhere.

# The 'stack' package is not (yet) whitelisted on Travis CI, so we need sudo to
# be able to install it. This does mean that we get a VM instead of a container,
# which is slower to boot. But 20 seconds on a ~dozen minute build is not that
# much, and it simplifies things a bit.

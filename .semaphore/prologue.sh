# Shared commands for the set-up phase of jobs

# This file is NOT usable with Semaphore's "commands_file" property, as this
# puts all the comments in this file in the build output and requires us to
# write all build steps on one line each. Instead, this file must be executed
# (not sourced) in the build pipelines where we use it.
# If the build requires the use of Nix, this command must be rerun afterwards:
# `source $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh`
# The reason for executing and not sourcing this file (and having to re-source
# nix.sh) is that sourcing interferes with Semaphore's job control flow: if a
# command would fail in this pipeline, it immediately causes Semaphore to abort
# the job, without running any cleanup commands or the epilogue (which we use
# to report failures to Healthchecks.io).

# We don't use `set -x` here to show the run commands, because this would show
# authentication tokens in the build output. Instead, `set -v` prints the
# commands "as they are read".
# We do want to exit immediately after encountering an error.
# We also cannot use "set -u", as Semaphore's tooling uses unset variables in
# some places (which we can't change).
set -evo pipefail

# Install Nix. We install in single-user mode (--no-daemon) because the Nix
# process can access the running SSH agent to fetch private Git repositories.

#
# We have this in addition to Cachix because we want to avoid hitting Cachix
# for individual store entries, as restoring `/nix` from the Semaphore cache in
# one go is a lot faster than downloading individual cache entries from
# Cachix's S3 + Cloudflare.
#
# We refresh the Nix store cache entry daily. It is populated after the first
# successful build of the day by our main pipeline.
#
# Restoring the cache can fail when the cache entry is only partially matched,
# because then it might still be in the process of being uploaded by Semaphore,
# which can be caused by a concurrent build. Since using the Semaphore cache is
# only an optimization, but not strictly necessary, we make sure that the build
# doesn't fail in this case, by making sure the exit code is always 0. When
# restoring the cache fails, we delete /nix to ensure that we are not left with
# a partially restored Nix store.
